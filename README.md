# Mercari_JetCompose_Riya-
This is my first attempt to use Kotlin & Jetpack Compose library.
Given that this is the entire new module from learning aspect & also, considering the short period of time for assessment skill which was in parallel to the working hours,
I could only try attempting to validation of 1 class - LoginScreen adhering to the Jetpack Compose library. End-to-end automation is covered in another GitHub project using Appium.
However, I will be really keen on learning this new library, Kotin language & synatx for the same.
